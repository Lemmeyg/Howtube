When resolving an issue or addressing error message:

- review the whole message before starting to consider next steps
- identify all different errors in the messages
- take a methodical approach to creating a solution.
- Always seek to address the cause of the issue, not the symptom.
- Do not settle for a work around 
- look the create the simpliest, most effective solution.
- A great solution requires the least code changes, resolves the issue, is less likely to cause issues else where in the application.
 - before creating new files and folders, check [Archtitecture.md](mdc:Archtitecture.md) and the codebase to ensure the file or folders aren't located elsewhere in the application.
